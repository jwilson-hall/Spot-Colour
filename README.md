# Spot-Colour

This project is the code submission for my final year project on: Spot-Colour

I plan to produce an application for processing images, which produces an image in a different style and with spot-colour. Spot colour is when a colour or object within an image has been kept in colour or been made more vibrant while the rest of the image has had a greyscale filter put over it. The purpose of this is to be able create a mask for a region of interest within the image. This has many applications in the area of image processing as there are many different solutions that attempt to solve this problem.
