This project is the code submission for my final year project on: Spot-Colour

All relevant research is contained within my paper, which is included within this repository.

This project makes use of COCO object detection models and datasets.

python prerequisites - can be obtained by running "python-setup.ps1"

Spot colour is when a colour or object within an image has been kept in colour or been made more vibrant while the rest of the image has been processed with a greyscale filter. The purpose of this is to be able create a mask for a region of interest within the image. This has many applications in the area of image processing as there are many different solutions that attempt to solve this problem.
